## Why do we need Quality assurance? 
Because we are all the same in one respect: even when we are sure, we can be 100% wrong.

Shift left in testing marked point where testing met quality assurance, which is concerned around ways of working. Checks implemented earlier in development cycle, will avoid error further down the pipeline. Checks such as UX team verifying design against accessibility standards, or introducing higher level tests to CI pipeline.

The technical side can be more easily chnaged, than the human side (the team), and key to success here is transparency. Business will end up with confidence they have the whole picture, and the team will work more effectively, not having to worry about "playing the game".

I follow BDD as test approach of choice, as it embraces a lean ethos and is by default embedded in the SDLC.  it can also help focus the business to think beyond a 3-liner user story, and thinking about examples to illustrate meaning more clearly. This gives the developers more direction, a better basis for creating acceptance tests, and a clearer shot of fulfilling expectations.

Quality at all stages in project pipeline needs regular reivew, and importantly, the team should feel they can be honest.
