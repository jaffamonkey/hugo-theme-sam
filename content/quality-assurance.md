### Why do we need Quality assurance? 
Because we are all the same in one respect: even when we are sure, we can be 100% wrong.

### Shifting left testing
[Shift left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing) is about implementing quality checks earlier in development cycle, even as far as Design and Business Analaysis. Shift left in testing marked point where testing met quality assurance, which is concerned around ways of working. Checks implemented earlier in development cycle, will avoid error further down the CI/CD pipelines.

### Shifting left design 
UX team can design against accessibility standards and design principles

### Shift left business analysis
BDD scenarios start “the conversation”, and t esting involvement starts at the point a User Story are created. BDD is a development approach, that is more user-focused, and is driven by Feature scenarios defined by the business. These scenarios start conversations that lead to a more clarified view of the user story, by working out what needs to happen, in order for a feature scenario test to “pass”. We then have a mechanism to test and also indicate progress of feature development (passing vs failing scenarion tests).

### The team
There there is the human side (the team), and key to success here is transparency. Business will end up with confidence they have the whole picture, and the team will work more effectively, not having to worry about "playing the game". Team building games are patching over problems, and not as inclusive an exercise as you might imagine. Focus on a transparent and supportive work culture will pay dividends

> Quality at all stages in project pipeline needs regular reivew, and importantly, the team should feel they can be honest.
