### Why do we need Quality assurance? 
Because we are all the same in one respect: even when we are sure, we can be 100% wrong.

### Shift left to testing earlier in the development cycle
[Shift left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing) is about implementing quality checks earlier in development cycle, even as far as Design and Business Analaysis. Shift left in testing marked point where testing met quality assurance, which is concerned around ways of working. Checks implemented earlier in development cycle, will avoid error further down the CI/CD pipelines.

### Shift left to design checks 
UX team can design against accessibility standards and design principles

### Shift left to business requirements
Adopting a specification by example approach (BDD-inpsired), breaking down user stories into testable scenarios start “the conversation”, and testing involvement These conversations lead to a more unified understanding of the user story, by working out examples which become testable scenarios. We then have a mechanism to test and also indicate progress of feature development (passing vs failing scenarion tests).

### The team
There there is the human side (the team), and key to success here is transparency. Business will end up with confidence they have the whole picture, and the team will work more effectively, not having to worry about "playing the game". Team building games are patching over problems, and not as inclusive an exercise as you might imagine. Focus on a transparent and supportive work culture will pay dividends

> Quality at all stages in project pipeline needs regular reivew, and importantly, the team should feel they can be honest.
