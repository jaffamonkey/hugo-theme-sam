## Why do we need Quality assurance? 
Because we are all the same in one respect: even when we are sure, we can be 100% wrong.

### Transparency
We have all heard this before, but these will never happen unless people can feel free to be themselves. Keep momentum on a project, with a group of individuals with complete freedom to express themselves. It’s a challenge, and a worthwhile one.

### CI/CD pipelines
Vital, but should be serving all needs and it is easy to fall into the trap of just celebrating they exist.

### Definition of Ready
As important as the DoD, as it controls quklaity of input inot the development lifecycle. Requirements need to be clear, and testable.

### Definition of Done
Everyone has a common idea of what sensibly indicates when a Feature is “Done”. However, everyone has also subtle variations on what they consider to be “Done”. Is it worth dissecting the DoD to a granular level to please everyone? No - keep it pragmatic.

### Requirements
In order to do effective criteria such as the DoD, the user story has to be clear, and it is worth chasing this process down. What helps is thinking beyond a 3-liner user story, and thinking about examples to illustrate meaning more clearly. This gives the developers more direction, a better basis for creating acceptance tests, and a clearer shot of fulfilling expectations.

Quality at all stages in project pipeline needs regular reivew, and importantly, the team should feel they can be honest.
